# Wireframes

In this part I use Balsamiq to finish the wireframe of my project. 

I will start with introducing the background of the cosmetics markets in United States. Cosmetics are a major expenditure for women all around the world. The global cosmetics market keeps growing steadily for the past few years, where United States takes largest place.  For instance, one data show that a large percentage of U.S. women purchases cosmetics products once a month on average, which indicates that cosmetics industries really take large place. Thus, my final project will mainly focus on the U.S cosmetics market. And the following graph is a brief visualization. (How it will look like in my final version)

Many companies start advertising champions and invest much on ads.I found detailed data showing advertising spending of selected brands in U.S。 L’Oréal is on the top and far greater than the rest brands. The advertising spending of another brand CoverGirl shows opposite tendency: decreasing every year since 2011. (In the wireframe I will mainly focus on the comparison between these L’Oréal and CoverGirls' ads spending from 2011 to 2016.)

I noticed that people have preferences other than L’Oréal on major types of makeup products. CoverGirl is the most well-known, preferred and frequently used brand instead of L’Oréal.

I took a closer look at some specific types of makeup products and CoverGirl is also user's favorite. In this part I will choose foundation as an example and make a data visualization.

And here is my conclusion after comparison.

I analyzed the reason behind this phenomenon. More and more people tend to use YouTube or other online platform to get known about each product where everyone can share their opinions and experiences. Compared to ads, those reviews are more convincing and real.

Thus, here is my "call to action"! Makeup companies should spend more money on improving their products instead of advertising. If the products are good enough, many professional or famous youtubers or bloggers would recommend them online.

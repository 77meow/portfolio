# Wireframes

In this part I use Balsamiq to finish the wireframe of my project. 

I will start with introducing the background of the cosmetics markets in United States. Cosmetics are a major expenditure for women all around the world. The global cosmetics market keeps growing steadily for the past few years, where United States takes largest place.  For instance, one data show that a large percentage of U.S. women purchases cosmetics products once a month on average, which indicates that cosmetics industries really take large place. Thus, my final project will mainly focus on the U.S cosmetics market. And the following graph is a brief visualization. (How it will look like in my final version)

Many companies start advertising champions and invest much on ads.I found detailed data showing advertising spending of selected brands in U.S, which can give readers a direct comparison on how much each company spent specifically on ads. L’Oréal is on the top and far greater than the rest brands. The advertising spending of another brand CoverGirl shows opposite tendency: decreasing every year since 2011. In the wireframe I will mainly focus on the comparison between these L’Oréal and CoverGirls' ads spending from 2011 to 2016.

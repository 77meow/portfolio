# Wireframes (First Version)

In this part I use Balsamiq to finish the wireframe of my project. 

I will start with introducing the background of the cosmetics markets in United States. Cosmetics are a major expenditure for women all around the world. The global cosmetics market keeps growing steadily for the past few years, where United States takes largest place.  For instance, one data show that a large percentage of U.S. women purchases cosmetics products once a month on average, which indicates that cosmetics industries really take large place. Thus, my final project will mainly focus on the U.S cosmetics market. And the following graph is a brief visualization. (How it will look like in my final version)

Many companies start advertising champions and invest much on ads.I found detailed data showing advertising spending of selected brands in U.S。 L’Oréal is on the top and far greater than the rest brands. The advertising spending of another brand CoverGirl shows opposite tendency: decreasing every year since 2011. (In the wireframe I will mainly focus on the comparison between these L’Oréal and CoverGirls' ads spending from 2011 to 2016.)

I noticed that people have preferences other than L’Oréal on major types of makeup products. CoverGirl is the most well-known, preferred and frequently used brand instead of L’Oréal.

I took a closer look at some specific types of makeup products and CoverGirl is also user's favorite. In this part I will choose foundation as an example and make a data visualization.

And here is my conclusion after comparison. <br>

I analyzed the reason behind this phenomenon. More and more people tend to use YouTube or other online platform to get known about each product where everyone can share their opinions and experiences. Compared to ads, those reviews are more convincing and real. <br>

Thus, here is my "call to action"! Makeup companies should spend more money on improving their products instead of advertising. If the products are good enough, many professional or famous youtubers or bloggers would recommend them online. <br>

# Data Visualization (First Version)



# User Research
<br>
I am targetting the following audience for my user research! <br>

  - My male friends who do not do make up or watch makeup videos. <br>
  I choose them as one the targetted audiences because they are totally not familiar with the topic at all. Thus, they can      give me direct feedback on whether my storytelling is clear or not. One of my goals is to let people without any knowledge about makeup understand what the story is. 
 
  - My roommate who barely does makeup but watches makeup youtube channel<br>
  I choose my roommate for the interview because she has some knowledge about makeup but is not very familiar with makeup market. The topic will not be strange to her and she might give me some advice from a different perspective from my male friends mentioend above. 
  
  - A mini makeup youtuber who are passionate about her makeup "business" and very familiar with every type of make brands.<br>
  I choose her because she can view my data visualization and storytelling from a perspective of an "expert" in the makeup market.
  <br>
 


## Method: in person interviews

 - Can you understand the story I am telling? (If no, can you indicate which part is confusing)<br>
 - Do you think the logic of the story makes sense? (If no, can you indicate which part is not making sense)<br>
 - Do you think my data visualization is vivid and easy to understand? <br>
 - Do you think my data visualization is beautiful?<br>
 - Is there anything I need to improve on?<br>
 - Is there anything you find inappropriate?<br>

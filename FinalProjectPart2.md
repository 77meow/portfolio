# Wireframes

In this part I use Balsamiq to finish the wireframe of my project. 

I will start with introducing the background of the cosmetics markets in United States. Cosmetics are a major expenditure for women all around the world. The global cosmetics market keeps growing steadily for the past few years, where United States takes largest place.  For instance, one data show that a large percentage of U.S. women purchases cosmetics products once a month on average, which indicates that cosmetics industries really take large place. Thus, my final project will mainly focus on the U.S cosmetics market. And the following graph is a brief visualization. (How it will look like in my final version)

Many companies start advertising champions and invest much on ads.I found detailed data showing advertising spending of selected brands in U.S。 L’Oréal is on the top and far greater than the rest brands. The advertising spending of another brand CoverGirl shows opposite tendency: decreasing every year since 2011. (In the wireframe I will mainly focus on the comparison between these L’Oréal and CoverGirls' ads spending from 2011 to 2016.)

I noticed that people have preferences other than L’Oréal on major types of makeup products. CoverGirl is the most well-known, preferred and frequently used brand instead of L’Oréal.

I took a closer look at some specific types of makeup products and CoverGirl is also user's favorite. In this part I will choose foundation as an example and make a data visualization.

And here is my conclusion after comparison. <br>
![Alt Text](https://github.com/77meow/portfolio/blob/master/New%20Wireframe%206.png?raw=true)<br>

I analyzed the reason behind this phenomenon. More and more people tend to use YouTube or other online platform to get known about each product where everyone can share their opinions and experiences. Compared to ads, those reviews are more convincing and real. <br>

Thus, here is my "call to action"! Makeup companies should spend more money on improving their products instead of advertising. If the products are good enough, many professional or famous youtubers or bloggers would recommend them online. <br>

# Data Visualization (First Version)
The following graphs are some of my data visualization work!<br>
For the specific story line, please see the part above!<br>
#### The glabal beauty market is briefly shown as the graph below. We can notice that US takes the largest place.<br>

# Story Arc
I draw the story arc picture as follow!<br>
![Alt Text](https://github.com/77meow/portfolio/blob/master/storyarc.jpeg?raw=true)
## I assume I have a wide range of audience including makeup consumers, cosmetics company like L'Oreal and Cover Girl
In the beginning, people migt feel happy about the US largest place in the global makeup market. After I put on the ads spending of the two makeup companies, readers might have questions: will the large spending on ads really help? According to the visualization I provided, people might feel suprised and feel confused and sorry about the result (since L'Oreal really spent greatly larger amount than CoverGirl!!) However, after reading my analysis, they might find a convincing reason and can take some actions in the future!

# User Research
<br>
I am targetting the following audience for my user research! <br>

  - My male friends who do not do make up or watch makeup videos. <br>
  I choose them as one the targetted audiences because they are totally not familiar with the topic at all. Thus, they can      give me direct feedback on whether my storytelling is clear or not. One of my goals is to let people without any knowledge about makeup understand what the story is. 
 
  - My roommate who barely does makeup but watches makeup youtube channel<br>
  I choose my roommate for the interview because she has some knowledge about makeup but is not very familiar with makeup market. The topic will not be strange to her and she might give me some advice from a different perspective from my male friends mentioend above. 
  
  - A mini makeup youtuber who are passionate about her makeup "business" and very familiar with every type of make brands.<br>
  I choose her because she can view my data visualization and storytelling from a perspective of an "expert" in the makeup market.
  <br>
 


## Method: in person interviews
<br>
## Questions: <br>
 - Can you understand the story I am telling? (If no, can you indicate which part is confusing)<br>
 - Do you think the logic of the story makes sense? (If no, can you indicate which part is not making sense)<br>
 - Do you think my data visualization is vivid and easy to understand? <br>
 - Do you think my data visualization is beautiful?<br>
 - Is there anything I need to improve on?<br>
 - Is there anything you find inappropriate?<br>
 
<br>
## Results<br>
### Positive<br>
- The logic of the story is understandable. (People without any makeup backgroun can easily understand the logic line)<br>
- Most of the graphs can deliver the correct information and is descriptive<br>
- My friends super agreed with the comclusion and suggesions on the topic as I proposed in the project. <br>
<br>
### Negative<br>
- Many data visualizations are very simple and not very interesting enough <br>
- Can use other forms instead of bar charts<br>
- The transition from the conclusion to my suggestion is a little bit awkward and feel like missing something<br>
- Can have more data on customers' criteria when choosing cosmetics since it is the most importamt and direct indication of how companies should act<br>
- The last graph (social media one) looks messy

## Changes
After collecting and summarizing the feedback from my friends, I decide not to change my wireframe a lot since the whole story has a clear logic and is understandable. The wireframse is a rough picture of the entire story. Instead, I would like to update some graphs in my data visualization part. I will use canva to make the graphs more engaged. I will make the following changes: 
- Change the comparison on foundation sales to be more descriptive
- For the platform visualization, only use the top3 data (which are Youtube, Facebook and Cosmetic Blog)

# Revised Data Visualization (Partially revised)
### I changed the bar chart of the global makeup market into the following graph since the original data has already used the bar chart!

### I use one foundation label to represent a million sale! It looks more fun!<br>
![Alt Text](https://github.com/77meow/portfolio/blob/master/Foundations.png?raw=true)<br>
<br>
### I also only leave the data for YouTube, Facebook and Cosmetic Blog and use a line chart to show an increasing tendency in recent years. <br>

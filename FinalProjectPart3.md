# The Idea
In this part you can find a high-level summary of my project. It includes a project structure that outlines the major elements of my story. There is also a short paragraph that documents my data sources, and an explanation of how I plan on using those data. In the end there are few paragraphs summarizing my approach to the project!<br>

# Final Data Story
### Intended Audience
In my story, there are two groups of intended audiences. One is the cosmetics companies and the other is customers in the US  market. <br>
##### Cosmetics Companies <br>
One goal of my study is to suggest cosmetics companies spend more money on improving product quality rather than advertising. In the beginning I showed that US takes the greatest cosmetics market share worldwide. This is the reason for why I specifically focused on the US cosmetics market. In addtion, in order to further narrow the foucs, I chose two leading companies L'Oreal and CoverGirl and made a comprehensive comparison between them. L'Oreal represents those companies who pay great efforts on the advertisement while Cover Girl represents those companies who does not spent much money on advertisements but is still most preferred by customers because of its good quality. In my project I first made a comparison on the two companies' ads spending. Then I evaluated the performance of the two companies from various aspects (most preferred, most well-known, most frequently used as well as some specific products' performance like foundations). According to my study result, L'Oreal spends times of money more than CoverGirl on advertisements while CoverGirl is the most well-known and frequently used one. Thus, I think my targetted audience, cosmetics companies, should focus more on improving product quality. 
##### Cosmetics Consumers <br>
Cosmetics customers is my second intended audience. In the last part of my study, I did an analysis on the customers' side. With the fast development of social media platforms, customers could share and search more information with others. Many people choose to watch makeup youtubers for product reviews before they make any decisions. If the product is good enough, lots of poeple would recommend them. In this way companies do not have spend huge amount of money on advertisements and what is more important is that customers can get more accurate and real feedback from other users. In this way customers can have a comparatively fair information comparred to only watching ads. <br>
#### Improving products' quality is a win-win strategy for both customers and companies nowadays.

# The Idea
In this part you can find a high-level summary of my project. It includes a project structure that outlines the major elements of my story. There is also a short paragraph that documents my data sources, and an explanation of how I plan on using those data. In the end there are few paragraphs summarizing my approach to the project!<br>

# Design and Research
In this part you can find the skecthes and storyboard I made before. I also did a user research to improve my data visualizations. The findings and updated versions of my graphs are shown in this part!<br>

# Final Data Story
### Intended Audience
In my story, there are two groups of intended audiences. One is the cosmetics companies and the other is customers in the US  market. <br>
##### Cosmetics Companies <br>
One goal of my study is to suggest cosmetics companies spend more money on improving product quality rather than advertising. In the beginning I showed that US takes the greatest cosmetics market share worldwide. This is the reason for why I specifically focused on the US cosmetics market. In addtion, in order to further narrow the foucs, I chose two leading companies L'Oreal and CoverGirl and made a comprehensive comparison between them. L'Oreal represents those companies who pay great efforts on the advertisement while Cover Girl represents those companies who does not spent much money on advertisements but is still most preferred by customers because of its good quality. In my project I first made a comparison on the two companies' ads spending. Then I evaluated the performance of the two companies from various aspects (most preferred, most well-known, most frequently used as well as some specific products' performance like foundations). According to my study result, L'Oreal spends times of money more than CoverGirl on advertisements while CoverGirl is the most well-known and frequently used one. Thus, I think my targetted audience, cosmetics companies, should focus more on improving product quality. 
##### Cosmetics Consumers <br>
Cosmetics customers is my second intended audience. In the last part of my study, I did an analysis on the customers' side. With the fast development of social media platforms, customers could share and search more information with others. Many people choose to watch makeup youtubers for product reviews before they make any decisions. If the product is good enough, lots of poeple would recommend them. In this way companies do not have spend huge amount of money on advertisements and what is more important is that customers can get more accurate and real feedback from other users. In this way customers can have a comparatively fair information comparred to only watching ads. <br>
#### Improving products' quality is a win-win strategy for both customers and companies nowadays. <br>

### Work Summary <br>
In my previous work, I mainly did the following two things to construct this comprehensive research on the US cosmetics markets. The two steps can also be generally applied to other project working process. <br>

#### Construct Outlines<br>
##### Sketches (Rough Draft)
Writing a proposal before starting the project is always a crucial step. It can efficiently improve my productivity in the further process. In my project, I listed an outline in part 1. This step can help me think of a whole picture of what my project is going to look like. I also sketched some draft graphs on paper based on the strcuture I created in the outline. After I have a rough draft, I can make a plan to contruct my project and focus on some detailed things step by step. <br>
##### Collecting Data<br>
After I had an idea, I tried to collect data that could support my ideas. This step took me lots of time because it is not easy to find clean and related datasets. In my project I downloaded data from Statista. The data is clean and I do not have to process it. After I found a usable dataset, I made a plan on how to use them in my project. My project is mainly divided into three parts. The first one is comparison on ads spending. The second one is comparison on product performance. The third one is analysis on the relationship between social media platform and cosmetics market. Each part would be supported by the data I found. <br>

#### Wireframes and User Research
I contructed a rough picture and collected surpportive datasets in the previous part. Then the second step is to fill in the story with concrete data visualization. I tried to come up with a whole story line in the wireframe part. Wireframe makes my story more clear and visiable. It is a structure without using valid data. Later I applied concrete data and finished the first version of my data visualization. One challenge I met is that the original data is in bar chart form so I need to find other perper forms. Each dataset delivers different information so it is better to use different and the most suitable graphs. I designed many types of visualization. One of the most interesting one I think is the one comparing the fondation sales. I did the visualization by using Canva. I chose two different foundation bottle graphs on Canva and let them represent two different cosmetics companies. This way makes my graph more fun and descriptive. <br>

#### Refelction <br>
Looking back at the whole process of my work, I think user reasearch part is a necessary part that I would definitely add to my further project working process. In part two I did a user research, which was interviewing my friends (or different intended audiences) and collecting feedback from them. I really learned a lot in this step. Sometimes it is hard to find things that need to change from our own perspective. However, my friends offered my many innovative ideas and suggestions so that I could improve my work and make it better. For instance, in my first version of the datavisualizations I used only line charts, pie charts and bar charts. It is readable but not fun. With advice from my frinds, I made efforts to improve my graphs to be more descriptive and vivid! User reseach gives me a chance to get feedback from various perpectives.

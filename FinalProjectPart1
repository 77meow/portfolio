# Outline 

In my final project based on a wide range of dataset, I will strongly recommend cosmetics company to invest more on improving product quality instead of advertising. According to the structure given by Good Charts, I will divide my final project in the following three parts. 

First, I will start with introducing the background of the cosmetics markets in United States. Cosmetics are a major expenditure for women all around the world. The global cosmetics market keeps growing steadily for the past few years, where United States takes largest place. Many companies start advertising champions and invest much on ads. 

However, one problem cosmetics companies may be facing is that advertisements gradually become a not so important factor that will influence consumers’ decision. With the fast development of social media in recent years, it becomes much more convenient for consumers to get and share more product reviews online. The effect of advertising would be weakened if the product itself is not as good as the ads say. 

Thus, my “call to action” is to suggest cosmetics companies to focus more on the product quality and variety instead of advertisements.

# The Data 

According to the data provided on Statista, I know that U.S has greatest value of the beauty and personal care market worldwide. I also found data related to cosmetics consumer behavior. For instance, one data show that a large percentage of U.S. women purchases cosmetics products once a month on average, which indicates that cosmetics industries really take large place. Thus, my final project will mainly focus on the U.S cosmetics market. 

My data source is Statista, where I can find comprehensive annual reports on cosmetics market in global and US. I found detailed data showing advertising spending of selected brands in U.S, which can give readers a direct comparison on how much each company spent specifically on ads. L’Oréal is on the top and far greater than the rest brands. The advertising spending of another brand CoverGirl shows opposite tendency: decreasing every year since 2011. (I will make comparison between these two brands)

I noticed that people have preferences other than L’Oréal on major types of makeup products. I collected data from the following aspects: most frequently used makeup brand, share of women familiar with selected make-up brands and brand preference for facial foundation, leading foundation, bronzer and lipsticks. I want to make a comparison between L’Oréal and other cosmetics brand based on customer’s reviews to see if greater amount of ads will definitely influence people’s decision. However, I found that only in the survey of preference for lipsticks L’Oréal is on the top ranking. 

In addition, I try to support my idea from a different perspective: the number of makeups youtubers has been increasing dramatically in the past few years. I also found a data showing that social media has greater and greater influence on determining people’s choice.

# Method and medium 

I will use Shorthand to display my data visualization and create a narrative story for my final project. 

First, I will put several bar charts to make a brief introduction on the global and US cosmetics market (to explain why I choose US market). Then I will add one visualization on comparison between the advertising spending of Loreal and CoverGirl from 2011 to 2016. L’Oréal had a dramatically greater spending than CoverGirl. So, the question would be raised in readers ‘mind: is greater spending necessarily influence people’s choice? 

Then I will use several data visualizations to answer the question above. CoverGirl was on the top of most frequently used brand, most well-known, and most preferred brand of many types of makeups like foundation and bronzer. Although L’Oréal was also on a high-ranking position, it is not as outstanding as Cavegirl and other brand with less ads spending. 

Thus, I would strongly recommend cosmetics companies to focus more on improving products’ quality for the following reason: 
First, according to one of my data, people would care the most about the quality of products. 
Second, more and more people tend to use YouTube or other online platform to get known about each product where everyone can share their opinions and experiences. Compared to ads, those reviews are more convincing and real. (This leads to the third point)
Third, if the products are good enough, many professional or famous youtubers or bloggers would recommend them online. To a large extent, this is also an efficient and economical to advertise their products. 
Now the society is under the trends of digital transformation and information tend to be fairly symmetric on both sellers’ and consumer’s sides. Thus, focusing most on product quality should be a preferred way for a brand’s development.

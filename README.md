This is my portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!


# About me

Under the About me and What I hope to learn sections, write a couple paragraphs about yourself including your name, pronouns, the program you're in, what you're interested in getting out of the course and what you are planning to do once you graduate.  You can include other information you think is helpful to the rest of the class, including a photo if you like - follow the Github markdown guide to learn how. You can leave leave the section under Portfolio blank, or you can pre-populate it with a few links to future assignments, including your final project.

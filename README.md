This is my portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!


# About me

Hello! My name is Wenqi Luo and you can just call me Elle. My preferred pronouns are she, her, hers. I am currently in MISM 16 month program. I majored in Probability&Statistics for my undergraduate study. My dream is to become an excellent data analysist. I am an enthusiastic, modest and optimistic skill learner and problem solver. What I felt most excited about is using techniques in my study field to solve the problem in real-life. I plan to work in US for two to three years and then go back to China. 

When I am not diving into the world of my academic field, I enjoy travelling around the world, meet different people and learn diverse culture. I am also a mini vlogger who are passionate in recording and sharing life with friends. Meanwhile, I has been learning painting by myself for several years. I enjoy time in the world of color. 


# What I hope to learn

I hope to learn how to present complicated data and stories behind it to the listener. Since I only have experiences in dealing with data (coding, proving and other super boring things :(), I really want to learn how to build a bridge between raw data and listener, to make those boring and abstract data unstandable. 

Telling what data indicates to others is very important. Raw data itself cannot communicate with audience itself. However, after some process like data visualization through various types of graphs, like storytellings using understandable language, the meaning of data can be vividly shown to people even though without any professional background. 

In addtion, making pretty graphs is also my expectation. I love managing colors since it will also help people understand the content. The art of using colors will not be learnt in any other courses I will take. Taking Telling Stories with Data is my valuable chance to develop my diverse skills.
